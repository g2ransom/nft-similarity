It's the most populated city of this country since two decades ago, a pandemic hit the whole region but this city. Some scientific studies proved that the air and the lifestyle of this place was protecting and keeping their residents healthy and everyone wanted to move there. Houses started to get unaffordable due to the heavy Real Estate demand and pollution was rising until the government created some laws to protect the environment, creating eco-buildings, and banning gas-powered vehicles.\n\nIt only uses renewable energy from solar panels and wind power.\n\nLeaf Creek healing properties are well known, so they built the ''Nifty ward'', where patients are seeing a significant improvement in their health by just living there."

The whole scenery was stunning, we were surrounded by mountains. \n\nWe rented a car on the second day and drove to the Eibsee, a lake in Bavaria, Germany, just 9 km away from where we stayed. When we got there, the sun was just setting, and the lake was still frozen. The temperature was rather cool, but one could still feel a little bit of warmth from the setting sun. \n\nThe whole journey was tremendous, but it was only the beginning.\n\n\nLove,\nChisa\n\n2268 x 1512 px\n"

It is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience \n\nThis photo was taken on the coastal road in a foggy weather. When I saw the statue on the beach and the gloomy landscape, this thought came to my mind and I waited for someone to pass by. It is as if the consciousness separated from the statue is walking in search in a misty world. It's like the journey has come to an end and it's back to its essence.\n"

The Ankole cow is a large beast that can grow up to 7ft tall and is known known for having majestic long horns, which can sometimes grow up to 1.8m (6ft.) long! For many of the communities that own them, the cows hold special significance. Traditional Ankole ceremonies often have dancers with their hands twisting in the air mimicking the shape of the horns on their cattle. For the Mundari community in Sudan, herdsmen often grow very strong bonds to their herd - often naming them and pampering them however they can.\n\nThis piece was minted as part of the inaugural fwb Fellowship collection. The sale of 'Bull Run' will fund and unlock a further 7 pieces in this collection.\n\nDimensions: 1500px x 1500px"

The next day, the same cat was nowhere to be found. I, however, got fixated on the idea that if you spot a black cat, it will definitely bring you some good luck. Many years later, I was running extremely late for a flight, when a black cat crossed my path as I rode on the pillion. Without a doubt, I felt assured that good luck was to follow. To my disbelief, the repercussions of reaching late had me miss the flight and experience a very difficult afternoon.

To everyone‚Äôs surprise, there was boiling hot water under the stone ‚Äì good enough to cook food in it. However, the food kept getting drowned in the hot water pond and the disciples looked at the Guru. Guru taught them a lesson in gratitude when he asked them to offer the food to God if they want to have it.

I equipped a space for photography at home and began to create lighting fixtures using plastic, cardboard, clothespins, ropes, filters, various construction lamps and self-designed devices. It was a real laboratory of light. I painted the walls in 6 colors. I did not go to Paris for my birthday, but spent all my savings on a new studio.\nThis photo was taken in the first photo shoot in the new space. I, this day, changed about 15 lighting options. And I liked this color the most. I started using it more and more often after that. This photo was the beginning of many photo shoots where there was only one color.\nIf it weren't for that, my path would turn in the other direction. Whether it was good or bad, I don't know. But because of this portrait, I was stuck in one color for a long time.\n\nLviv, Ukraine\nMarch, 2020\n4016‚Ää√ó‚Ää5020px, jpg"

All the money I managed to save, I spent on the studio, the model's fee and props for photo shoots. At that time I had no opportunity to buy a professional camera, because I didn't even have enough money to live in Ukraine. Only a miracle could help me.\n\nI really wanted the models in my photos to be the most beautiful. But since I was a beginner they didn't want photographed free. That day I paid the model my last money, because I really dreamed that she was in my photos. This was the main thing for me and brought me more joy than anything.\n\nAnd a couple of months later a miracle happened! I posted a few photos on the Behance website. Adobe wanted to use this photo in one of its videos and offered me $ 1,000 for it. After that I borrowed more money and bought a professional photographic equipment.\n\nLviv, Ukraine\nOctober, 2018\n3456‚Ää√ó‚Ää5184px, jpg\n"

I had a motto - Fight for art, and it remains.\nThen I assembled a team and we shot my first fashion editorial. This story was published in the New York online magazine KUNST. It was very prestigious to get into it. After that, my life changed. I was noticed and began to cooperate with me. Models who previously ignored my requests for cooperation - began to be photographed for free.\nThis photo is very significant and important for me.\nWhen I was taking this photo, I noticed that model Sofia can close one eye very well. I asked to do this several times on camera. My friends initially doubted this photo, but I believed in it to the last and continue to believe in it and in my motto - Fight for art!\n\n\nLviv, Ukraine\nFebruary, 2019\n4016‚Ää√ó‚Ää5020px, jpg\n"

   "description": "Monolithic nanoporous metal foams constitute a broad class of materials with unique structure and properties. The structure resembles a disordered three-dimensional maze of condensed open cells where relatively thick ligaments interconnect with massive nodes. Voids and matter are very close to each other on the nanometre scale, giving rise to two bi-continuous, complementary networks. The intricate architecture is the result of the atomic-scale selective dissolution of less noble chemical elements from Au-based binary or multinary alloys. Proceeding gradually via the removal of individual atoms from the alloy surface and the subsequent rearrangement of neighbouring sites, dealloying eventually induces deep changes in the surface morphologies and the local degree of porosity. The resulting structure consists of solid ligaments and nodes that have characteristic lengths reduced down to the nanometre size, which imparts on the material intriguing physical and chemical properties."

New stories are told. Stories like postcards sent out of the world of dreams and fears. Stories with enigmatic humor and winking eyes. Surreal greetings from ‚ÄûAbsurdistan‚Äú. Humorous and serious contemplation of our past and present ..... fragments of history from a world that in and of itself is often completely out of joint.\nEvery picture represents a small intervention in nature.

Travelling, searching, carrying bulky bags of camera equipment on and off planes, boats and helicopters, years of swimming with a camera in a waterproof housing - to seek out these moments of ephemerality.\n\nOce captured, this singular moment is then transformed into a mesmerizing moving image, detailing the ocean‚Äôs myriad of colours and textures, as well as its immense power."

Overlaid with a repetition of meandering calligraphic strokes the 'garden' is depicted as if from an aerial perspective, and at once an olfactory one. \n\nThe INFINITY MATRIX are abstractions of nature, space, time and the cosmic realm referred to in Chinese Daoist philosophy as the Dao (The Way). In these works I draw together modern abstraction with Chinese calligraphic strokes to create vast immersive spaces in which to mind wander within.\n\nThese works are formed through a hand painted automative repetition of 5 calligraphic strokes. These works act as a vehicle for connection between artist, audience and the metaphysical realm. They celebrate the power of art and its capacity to enhance human experience and consciousness.\n\n‚àû [ ]"

   "description": "The Snake represents the negativity and disbelief that surrounds us. The representation of temptation can become part of your subconscious when you have to go through a healing path. When someone is discouraged, over and over again, your subconscious will get stuck in the wrong pattern, leading to self-sabotage. The healing comes when you rediscover yourself and listen to your intuition daily. A daily practice that brings you happiness can help you rewire the old pattern that unconsciously impacts your life.\nThe butterflies represent the possibility of you becoming happy and fulfilled. Butterflies symbolise spiritual rebirth, transformation, and change, but will you make space for them to heal you?\nIn my path, I have used mindfulness and numerology to rediscover myself and create space for transformation. \nAnd so, I decided to offer this artwork‚Äôs collector a personalised numerology reading and a personalised meditation to strengthen your inner power."

Like Tarkovsky who inspires me.\n\nFor the \"Dancer Dots\" digital art project, it was about scanning multiple portions of that time and then digging through that scan to find the best frame possible.\n\nThis frame was extracted from a LiDAR scanning session with Maya. It was then enhanced and color graded.\n\nMaya is a contemporary dancer who explores the slow and the self. A constant and slow movement between the inside and the outside. Like a pendulum.\n\nThe core ideas of the project are:\n\n- Show dance and movement differently, using technology.\n- Giveback to the dancers and dance communities.\n- As a collector, be an important part of a project (gifts, be a part of the creative process)\n- Get enough funds to make a 3D animation short film with scanned dancers or collectors.\n- Split the profits with everyone participating in this project (dancers, collectors, animators...etc.)\n\nFor more information, on this project: https://www.dancerdots.com/\n\n"

Thus, they fought against each other.\n\nBoth survived. My grandfather returned to his native town Balti (currently - Moldova), and his brother settled in France. Only in 1986, when the Iron curtains almost fell, the descendants of the French branch were able to visit their historical homeland for the first time.\n\nIt was strange meeting of totally different cultures. Even on the photo you can see how different are my grandparents and their grand-nephews.\n\n80 years after the war we, the descendants, still keep in touch and sometimes visit each other. Although we are totally different and even speak different languages.\n\nThe photo revives the history of individuals,  entire generations and countries."

In December 1992 the ship Demetrios, formerly the Long Lin from China, was being towed by a tug from Dunkirk to a Mediterranean scrapyard. During big storms in the English Channel, the tow broke and the z drifted helplessly. The ship struck the rocks at Prawle Point on 18 December, breaking her back in a few hours. \n\nI‚Äôve had this image in mind for several years, but it was only recently, during Storm Eunice, that I managed to capture the shot I envisaged. I wanted to capture the treacherous reefs and the stormy seas. I was also lucky to include part of the Demetrios which is visible within the frame."

Our house is 65m2, but we said, maybe we will get a big house in the future because they say the real estate bubble will burst in 2056, then we will have a nice house too. We said we'll use it then. \n\nWe brought it, we put it, it actually cleans very well, but there is a problem. This thing multiplies! When it multiplies, it multiplies again! What am I suppose to do with so many robots bro? We gave them away to the neighbor, gave it to the relatives. A few months passed, everyone in the whole country became a robot owner. Everyone has finished the house work, they have their vineyards and gardens cleaned. Of course, there is no end to this work, those who escaped from the garden gates got involved in nature as well. They are spread over vast deserts. Big world my man, how cleaning can possibly end right?  "

I saw them in the garden one day. While my girl was listening, it keeps telling something eagerly. Turns out, I didn't figure how to use this properly. If you don't ask It just reports ''Yeaa, it is a fine moon'' and shuts down.But if you ask properly, it tells you a long and a beatiful story.\n\nI asked one day; ''can you go to the stars ?'' It said ''Yes,Of course^^''. \n\nAfter a while, we lost interest in it.One day, I realizd it was standng in the middle of our garden.It was its shooting position and eyes were missng.I took its controller and saw it.It was shooted to the stars! Who knows where it is now..I sat next to its empty body and realized two sad thngs. First, when the eyes come back, we will all be gone probably. Second and the worst, we are not going to be able to listen to its legendary journey ever."

Since the object was so small on google maps I couldn‚Äôt be 100% sure if it was definitely a tree, but my interest had been peaked and I knew I wanted to see it in person.\n\nAfter countless hours of driving into the western Australian outback, I arrived to the salt lake. To my excitement, there was a perfectly intact fallen tree laying amongst the pink salt lake. The thought of the tree being there for years, slowly being reclaimed by nature and preserved in the salt is what was so captivating about this spot. "

Sometimes in our lives we go through a very low phase in our life when we need some motivation \u0026 salvation to restore back faith and positive intent in our life. During this work i had a small accident and i was completely confined to my room, where art was the rescue for me to bring the positivity. There are some memories in our life which we never forget,some of them when i faced during creating this work. The final result of this not only motivated me but brought back the enthusiasm of creativity in me. It took me 17 days to create this work. But i enjoyed the process completely and i slowly recovered from the injuries of my accident to simultaneously . Art is sometimes not only a healer but a path shower for many of us in our life. Its truly our each work is a part of our life, sorrows \u0026 pain . I am really proud of this work and it is source of light for me.  The size of this work is 34 MB.

I was attracted by her responsiveness, sincerity and support. All this I have felt throughout all these days here. That's what prompted me to buy one of her works. Subsequently, she also became my collector. In her works, she flawlessly displays the beauty of the female body, its fragility, tenderness, but at the same time incredible endurance. From the first seconds of our IRL meeting I realized that in front of me is a person close to me. She almost immediately started calling me \"elk\" - she thought I was much shorter and smaller, and this nickname was fixed on me. Even before we met, we decided to do this shoot, but I couldn't even imagine that all this would eventually turn into a real and strong friendship. I am glad to show you her as I saw her. With huge shining eyes and a completely unquenchable thirst for art. Fragile, but strong. Kind and empathetic."

However, the food kept getting drowned in the hot water pond and the disciples looked at the Guru.

Other times its a loud but repetitive vibration that at first has little pattern, but soon the rhythm of conspiracy is the only melody to play through your mind like a sickness that can't be cured. \n\nWhat would they think, indeed, if they knew what you really liked?

After hours of scouring google maps in search of anything unique, something caught my eye. A small salt lake in the middle of nowhere with what looked like a fallen tree in the centre of it. Since the object was so small on google maps I couldn‚Äôt be 100% sure if it was definitely a tree, but my interest had been peaked and I knew I wanted to see it in person.\n\nAfter countless hours of driving into the western Australian outback, I arrived to the salt lake. To my excitement, there was a perfectly intact fallen tree laying amongst the pink salt lake. The thought of the tree being there for years, slowly being reclaimed by nature and preserved in the salt is what was so captivating about this spot. "

I had the opportunity to dive in a hidden gem located in the heart of the jungle in Quintana Roo. I got goosebumps as I descended and became aware of the enormous depth and darkness of this cenote. The only source of light is a single beam that penetrates the depths and illuminates the sulfide cloud at a depth of about 30 meters. It seems as if the beam of light reaches into the unknown, the darkness, the 'ad infinitum'. A dive I will never forget. "

And while they are free, they are very happy without realizing it!\nAs soon as you touch their wings, your fingers become colored. It may kill them, or if they are very lucky, they may fly back short with damaged wings. We have all been butterflies at least once in our lives ... sitting in the arms of someone who once loved us! Our body is a big wound covered with colored skin ...! \nAnd wounds ...\nWounds are the source of our pain. We have finally generously given our pigments to the hands of someone we love, but their emptiness will eventually kill us."

   "description": "When an artwork speaks to an artist, there is always the potential for an homage. In this case, the PieceMaster has found inspiration on the walls of Miami, namely a piece of graffiti created by Chris Brown and Ron Bass (which marks the latter artist‚Äôs first foray into graffiti). Deft use of a variety of materials and textures allows the PieceMaster to capture and embellish the spirit of the original, which was created as an offering to the hurt and troubled Overton neighbourhood of Miami. Despite its placement and intent, the original also featured a fantastical splash of colors and whimsical shapes, all of which are set off by jagged negative spaces‚Äîthe PieceMaster has taken care to faithfully recreate the whole piece, and even the incidental elements such as piping. The creative exuberance of the original is here enhanced by a multilayered, three dimensional execution, and brought vividly to life by textural variety."
